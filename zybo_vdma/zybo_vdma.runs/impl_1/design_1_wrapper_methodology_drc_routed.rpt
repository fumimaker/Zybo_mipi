TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out3_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '69' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

The option '-to : [all_registers -clock [get_clocks -of [get_ports -scoped_to_current_instance clk]]]' of the following constraint is attached to some replicated objects but not to the corresponding original object. Please review the missing original objects and assess if they need to be included in the constraint.
